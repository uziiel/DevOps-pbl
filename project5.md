# CLIENT-SERVER ARCHITECTURE WITH MYSQL

Understanding Client-Server Architecture
As you proceed your journey into the world of IT, you will begin to realise that certain concepts apply to many other areas. One of such concepts is â€“ Client-Server architecture.

Client-Server refers to an architecture in which two or more computers are connected together over a network to send and receive requests between one another.

In their communication, each machine has its own role: the machine sending requests is usually referred as "Client" and the machine responding (serving) is called "Server".
